 👋 Hi, I’m @rubru2019. Since 2019 I am teaching in the Informatics Data & Insights area at the University Hogeschool Leiden. 
 I have worked as BI & DI consultant for SAS Institute for many years. I am inspired by Open Source and underlying idea of sharing.
 Linux, Python, Pentaho Kettle, Hop Apache are nice examples.
 When you have project in the Data & Insights area and looking for cooperation with students...don't hestitate to contact me. 
 Always looking for projects that we can use during our education. Bringing theory into practise and to make mistakes is the best way to learn :).
